a representation of the real world
requires some data about the real world

analytical model: equation or function that represents data

h(t) = 2t + 7
input: t
output: h

physical models: smaller scale physical representation 
problems w scaling tho

numerical models
lot o calcs so usually computer models
usually break the system into smaller parts that interact with each other
computer is used to keep track of interactions
